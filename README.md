# What is PandaMammyGame

- I created this game with my partner for Kaboom Game Jam and recieved over 1.5k plays and a honorary mention at the finals.
- You can compile and play it or use Replit where it hosted to play it in your browser: https://replit.com/@BerivanUcan/Panda-Mommy
- I am quite proud that I was able to learn a Game Engine in a week and create such loved game with some JavaScript Wizardy. 
- It is the first thing that comes up when you type Panda Mommy Replit in Google! Wow!
